# Dug Sensitivity

## Introduction
For this task, we are interested in the prediction of patientsâ€™ sensitivity to multiple drugs from routine H\&E images.

## Usage
To perform this the distance matrix of the entire TCGA and its corresponding slide IDs located at `data/MMD_matrix/D_1052_blur_10.npy` and `data/MMD_matrix/slide_IDs_1052.npy` respectively are used.In the code we then filter this matrix to only contain relavant BRCA samples inline with the baseline study. You can also use your distance matrix by using `MMD_distance_matrix_generator`.

To perform Dug Sensitivity prediction for our MMD-based approach Run `DrugSensitivity/predict_sensitivity.py` to first filter the relvant samples from BRCA and then train a Support Vector Regressor for each compound separately. The results of 5-fold cross validation are stored as a list in `DrugSensitivity/results.pickle`. Each entry of results corresponds to one of the folds such that a given entry is a $D\times 2$ matrix $R^j$ where D is the number of drugs used in the study ($D=427$) and $j$ is the fold $j \in 1..5$. THe two columns of the matrix, for a given drug at row $i$, correspond to the spearman rank coeffeicent ($R_{i,0}$) and its associated p-value ($R_{i,1}$) .
